# READ ME file for My.Miyagi
The following code is for the game Mr.Miyagi where he will respond depending on the users input

## Here I learnt:
-If statements
-While
-Input
-Functions
-The input was also markdown 

This also used git and was pushed to git hub
DRY was applied as well to reduce repeated statements
